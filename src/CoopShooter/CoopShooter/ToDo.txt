Add More PowerUps
Add power up that increases gun range
add power up that increases gun reload speed
refine power up that adds a gun (should maybe be aquired after reaching a certain score rather then a pickup)
Players need to bounce off eachother

power up ideas
maybe a projectile that multiplies when it hits enemy
sine wave
orbit shield thing that activates for a bit
shield so when you get hit you dont die but you do lose the shield

Add score manager - prolly singleton again for saving data and stuff
