Add More PowerUps
add power up that increases gun reload speed
refine power up that adds a gun (should maybe be aquired after reaching a certain score rather then a pickup)
Players need to bounce off eachother

power up ideas
maybe a projectile that multiplies when it hits enemy
sine wave
orbit shield thing that activates for a bit
shield so when you get hit you dont die but you do lose the shield - done

Add score manager - prolly singleton again for saving data and stuff

Add spawn indicators for enemies. Make a rect to represent the graphics device viewport area. have enemies spawn a indicator texture along the path from them to their target on an x or Y cord of the viewport rect. while the enemies x or y is outside the viewport rect show the indicator. use just a bool that checks pos for this
